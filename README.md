## [Memory Card Game](https://click-remember.netlify.app/)
- This is a simple memory card game created with React.
- The game is simple, you have to click on a card and remember that you've clicked on it. The cards will shuffle and you have to click on a card that you haven't clicked on before. If you click on a card that you've already clicked on, you lose the game.
